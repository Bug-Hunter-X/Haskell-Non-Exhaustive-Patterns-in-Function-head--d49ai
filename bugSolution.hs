The solution involves adding a proper pattern match for the empty list case.

```haskell
-- Correct function
head'' :: [a] -> Maybe a
head'' [] = Nothing
head'' (x:_) = Just x
```

This revised version uses the `Maybe` type to gracefully handle the empty list case, returning `Nothing` when the list is empty and `Just x` when it's not.
